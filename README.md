== **MoreRecipes 1.0.1**==
More Recipes was developed as a way to get vanilla blocks through alternative recipes, add new blocks, and make new recipes for vanilla items you couldn't get in Survival before.

Why is this better than using a Recipe maker to make your own recipes? No need for you to take images to document the recipes that you've added, every recipe can be found on http://www.jamoscraft.owexz.net/morerecipes.html

Builds:

Builds which have a -S on the end of the file require SpoutPlugin to run, as of now it offers more crafting than the Bukkit Port and is required to craft diamonds.
Builds which have a -B on the end of the file don't require SpoutPlugin, the latest version contains a configuration file to turn recipes on and off.

== **Features:** ==
GetChainMail does exactly what you think it does, it allows Chainmail armour to be crafted in survival, finally! Chainmail is made out of a mix of Iron Ingot and String, allowing you to save on iron, but at the cost of the armour being only slightly stronger than gold armour.

ExtendedString adds new recipes for string, simply by placing a piece of wool in a crafting table you can get 2 pieces of string. You can also fill a crafting table up with 9 string to get cobwebs!

BetterStone adds recipes for Mossy Cobblestone, Mossy Brick and Cracked Brick, check out the recipes below.

SimpleGrass allows you to craft Grass and Mycelium out of Dirt and Seeds/ Brown & Red Mushrooms respectively, to craft them, look at the below recipes.

MoreFood gives the ability to craft Apples out of leaves and sugar, as well as providing a way to get more Cocoa Beans (I know it just creates 2 beans out of 1 bean and sugar, but I couldn't think of another recipe.)

EasyStorage allows for Sandstone and Clay Balls to be turned into Sand and Clay respectively, allowing for the use of them as storage blocks.

ExtraBlocks allows for the creation of both Sponge and Clay, check out the recipes for more detail.

MoreMusic allows players to create every Music Disc in the game, adding another 8 Music Discs to Survival, while allowing the other.

Gardener gives the ability to turn Sugarcane into Sticks, Sticks into Wooden Planks and Leaves into Lillypads, Ferns and Tall Grass.

ReOre allows you to turn your mined materials back into ore however you still have to mine/smelt them to use the ores again.
